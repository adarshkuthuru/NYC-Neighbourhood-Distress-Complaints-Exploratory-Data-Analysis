# An Analysis of Neighbourhood Distress complaints (311 Service Requests) in NYC 

**Author**:  Adarsh Kuthuru


The information within this repository provides a comprehensive analysis of NYC 311 Service requests and the corresponding community districts where they were documented.

## Introduction:

The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of current NYC 311 call data. By carefully examining the details encompassing the nature of the issues, the timing and frequency of the calls, as well as their geographical distribution, government agencies and local policymakers can enhance their provision of services to NYC residents. Through extensive exploratory analysis and insightful data visualization of the publicly available 311 Service Requests data, this project endeavors to contribute to the existing understanding of the call landscape. Moreover, the modeling section aims to present a practical tool that serves as a proof-of-concept, efficiently facilitating residents' connection with the appropriate government services.

## Data
The project sourced data from two main repositories:

1. [NYC Open Data's 311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)

This dataset encompasses over 24 million 311 service requests made in New York City over the past decade. It includes details such as location, time, complaint type, and status. For this project, a subset of the data from 2023 was utilized, accessed through the Socrata Open Data (SODA) API.

2. [NYC Department of City Planningâ€™s Community District Profiles](https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/)

The Community District Profiles website provides access to indicators data by selecting a specific profile and downloading the data. These datasets offer information on development and population for each Community District in New York City. Additionally, the 311 dataset contains community board names, which correspond to the community districts in question.
